# Lexical Analyzer
The problem assigned was to create a syntax analyzer using one of the following methods: recursive descent, predictive recursive descent, or table-driven predictive parsing. The syntax analyzer must be able to correctly identify arithmetic expressions, assignment statements, single declarative statements, while, and single if statements  based on the rules provided in class. In addition, the program should be able to generate meaningful error messages as well as print to an output file containing the tokens, lexemes and the production rules used.

## How to Use
Download the project from the group's GitHub repository: https://github.com/NamanhTran/Syntax-Analyzer </br>
Using the command line, navigate to the project folder and run the following:</br>
```g++ main.cpp -o main``` </br>
```./main.out tests/test1.txt``` </br>
An output file called output.txt will be generated.
